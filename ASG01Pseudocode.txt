ASG01 Psuedocode

import the needed libraries

declare a main class

in that class:

create a world mars
populate the world with a picture
put my name in world
create a turtle joe
set the color and pen of joe
create a turtle sue
set color and pen of sue
move joe to create line, then circle, varying pen color
move sue to create line, varying pen visibility
  
notes: 

making a circle will require equations for
circles in a cartesian coordinate system
and a loop (for?)

Gimp is good place to start for tool to
compare my output w/ Baldwin's + get
initial idea of coordinates and colors

Gimp didn't work out :(
